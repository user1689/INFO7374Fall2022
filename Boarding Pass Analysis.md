Some potential problems in Alaska airline boarding pass.

- Hierarchy: The information provided is a bit messy and irregular, and it is difficult to rely on logic to find the approximate location of the information
- Importance: Some field information is missing, so that passengers can only identify the meaning of the field through the information
- Relative prioritization: The font size of relatively unimportant information is too large, which affects the reading of normal information

### Information architecture elements of new boarding pass

In order to define the information architecture of the new boarding pass, I want to show my Guidelines.

1. Formatting the information, and divide and display the information according to the usage scenarios
2. Prioritize showing some important information, easy to user experience 

### Print/Kiosk version

For this version, user is part of people who is older, which means they is not good at using Mobile. So they prefer to print boarding pass with help of employee of airport or use Kiosk machine print boarding pass by themselves.

- Hierarchy: Arrange the information in a neat layout and clearly separate the customer and employee parts, which can make the boarding pass more tidy. 
- Importance: Adding fields before some important information, such as gate, check-in time, seat number, etc., makes the learning curve less steep for first-time flight attendants.
- Relative prioritization: Remove unnecessary images so that customers can find the information they are looking for at first glance. At the same time, the relevant information is grouped into one piece according to the user scenario, such as the check-in port, the check-in time, and flight number, which belong to the pre-boarding scenario. The seat number and the departure time belong to the post-registration scenario.

#### Benefits

User perspective: Users do not need to worry about air tickets themselves, they only need to arrive at the counter or consult the relevant staff, which is very convenient.

Bussiness perspective: Airlines can take this opportunity to increase brand awareness and recognition, showcase corporate services, and increase users' trust and sense of belonging to the company.

### Mobile version

The user of this people is relatively younger, they can view their boarding pass anytime, anywhere with internet access and don't need to worry about losing their boarding pass.

- Hierarchy: Compared with the traditional horizontal layout, here I choose the vertical layout, in order to cater to the browsing habits of users' mobile phones.
- Importance: The same as the Print/Kiosk version, the corresponding fields will be added to the information for easy reading.
- Relative prioritization: First show a simplified version, which only has the departure place, destination, check-in time, arrival time, check-in gate, flight number, and seat number. Also provides a link on the e-ticket to the full version, which provides all the information about the flight.

#### Benefits

User perspective: Users can choose the language they are familiar with, and at the same time, the ticket will not be lost or damaged, and the record will be permanently available.

Bussiness perspective: The Mobile boarding pass reduces employee stress and reduces corporate ticket printing and management expenses.
